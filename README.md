## üìö About LLMs

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT are trained on massive datasets of text.  
They learn language structure, facts, and reasoning skills, which allows them to:

- Answer questions conversationally.
- Generate text (stories, summaries, code, etc.).
- Provide explanations and tutoring.
- Assist with real-world applications like chatbots and assistants.

> üí° **Why GPT-4o Mini?**  
> It‚Äôs optimized for speed and cost-efficiency while still offering strong reasoning and conversational ability.
